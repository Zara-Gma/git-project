# EXERCISE 1: Clone and create new repository

    Clone git repository, creating a new local copy and
    push it to your own Gitlab remote repository.

# EXERCISE 2: .gitignore

You see that build folders and editor specific folders are in the repository and decide to ignore it as a best practice.

    Ignore .idea folder, .DS_Store, out and build folders

Hint: remove from git cache first
